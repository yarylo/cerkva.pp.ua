Quick Sticky is a very simple plugin that makes it easier to quickly feature or “sticky” posts from the posts overview screen.

== Description ==

Quick Sticky is a very simple plugin for WordPress that makes it easier to quickly feature or “sticky” posts from the posts overview screen. It is a huge time saver when dealing with sticky posts.

On occasions I have also created sites where I have only wanted one sticky post at a time. The plugin contains a filter which allows you to enable this behaviour. Simply add the following snippet of code to your theme functions.php file:

`add_filter('qs_one_post_only', '__return_true');`

Once enabled, toggling a post as sticky will un-sticky (or un-feature) all of the other posts.
